# Curcumin-Bio-Project
Biol 333 final project - data from testing effects of curcumin on the immune system

Excel Workbook contains a number of sheets:

The first bunches are groups of ~3, sharing a date as the title. These are the raw data from the lab where we would test the viability and activity of immune cells with varying amounts of curcumin added. Viability is what percent of the cells were estimated alive, and CD25+/- was the marker for whether the cell was activated. Each stats page has a bar chart showing the results of that day. Then each day of data has 2 more sheets with graphs with the raw cell counts that were aggregated into the statistics. The first set of graphs are isolating the likely living cells by their size, and the second set takes the alive subset and sections it off by amount of activity marker present to make a threshold of active/inactive.

At the end there are 3 more sheets. Combined data includes a table of all the measurements for a combined graph. Trials significance test pulls the data back out and runs some t-tests to check for outliers. Trials graphs contains finalized graphs with significance bars included.

Then the powerpoint was our slides presented in class.
